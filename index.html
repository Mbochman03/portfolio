  <h2>Extra things you should know about me.</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>I can fix almost anything by referring to Youtube, as long as it doesn't require specialty tools.</li>
    <li>I love to cook but hate leftovers. Everyday is a new opportunity for food.</li>
    <li>I'll drive a car until it catches on fire. No, seriously my first car as a teenager caught on fire while waiting to get it inspected.</li>
